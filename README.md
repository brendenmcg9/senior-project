# senior-project

- Web app created for the Rowan University Human Services department by my Senior Project group

- Students/supervisors can register an account and login (seperate rollIDs for seperate web pages).

- Students are able to submit, save, and edit timesheets, view supervisors and related students, change their passwords

- Supervisors are able to approve or reject student timesheets, view the students they supervise, add and edit field sites (where the students work), and also change their passwords

- Web app was created using Bootstrap framework, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and MySQL

- My contributions to this project include ALL of the Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. I also managed and tweaked some of the PHP.

- Due to deadlines the code was never able to be fully commented
